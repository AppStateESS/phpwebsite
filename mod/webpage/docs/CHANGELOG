  the login screen. If the user was already logged in however, they
  would get to see the Volume anyway.

20 September 2007
+ Several permission checks were not using the correct item name
  (volume).
+ Approval tab is no longer seen by restricted users.

+ Fixed: Approval pages where not limited by volume number causing all
  unapproved pages to list when a volume was viewed.

  last updated them. This will allow them to edit while still in the
  queue.
+ Unapproved pages are listed with an [Unapproved] label in the volume
  listing. 
+ Fixed: Restricted users were not seeing the front page and active
  status.

+ Incorrect commands to the user class will forward to a 404 page.
