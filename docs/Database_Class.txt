Introduction
The phpWebSite database class is meant to prevent the tedious creation
of long sql strings and to assist the beginning programmer to access
the database. It uses the PEAR DB library as its backbone.

Most of the functions return a result. The result varies except in the
case of an error. If there is an error, you will receive a PEAR error
object.


Accessing the database statically.
If you do not wish to create a object for phpwebsite, you can
access the database directly using these functions:

PHPWS_DB::loadDB(dsn)
When phpws_db is accessed, it will load the database according to
phpwebsite's configuration file. If you need to change the database
connection then you can send a different dsn string to this function.
For information on the dsn format please read this page:
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db.intro-dsn.php

PHPWS_DB::query(sql)
You can send any database query string to this function. The result
depends upon the usage. See this page for more details:
http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db.intro-query.php
Note: You should always be cautious when using a straight query as
they are a common target of SQL injection.

PHPWS_DB::select(type, query)
Select can be called statically and from an object. To call it
statically, enter the "type" of return you want and the select
"query". For select types, see below.


PHPWS_DB::listTables()
Returns a list array of tables in your database.

PHPWS_DB::isTable(table_name)
Returns TRUE if the submitted table name is in the current
database. Returns FALSE if it is not.


PHPWS_DB::listDatabase()
Returns a list of databases that are accessible by your dsn entry.

PHPWS_DB::lastQuery()
Returns the last query sent to the PEAR database object.


The following functions cannot be called statically, however they do
not require a table assignment.

$db->import(text)
This function will take a database export and attempt to import it
into the current database.

$db->export(tableName, structure, contents)
This function will return a text string export of a specific table.
If structure is TRUE (default value) then you will get back the CREATE
TABLE information. If $contents is TRUE (default value) you will
receive the contents of that table as well (or instead of if structure
is FALSE).


Constructing a database object
Creating an object allows easier manipulation of complicated queries.

To get started, construct a phpws db object like so.

$db = & new PHPWS_DB("tableName");

The table name is not mandatory, you could add it later like so:

$db->setTable("tableName");

Now you decide what kind of query you require: select, insert, update,
delete, create or drop table, create or drop column, etc.

(Note: from here on, the database object's creation ($db) is implied
when it is used in an example.)


SELECT
The select function has many options to determine its results.

We will use the following table (named "friends") as an example:

id   |   name   |   age    |  sex
------------------------------------------
3    | Chris    |   33     | male
4    | Lucy     |   22     | female
5    | Laura    |   44     | female
6    | Mike     |   22     | male
7    | Chris    |   18     | female      


Once you have created your object you merely need to call:
$result = $db->select();

An array of rows found will be placed into the $result variable.

The result here would be an array with the following form:

0 =>  id    => 3
      name  => Chris
      age   => 33
      sex   => male
      
1 =>  id    => 4
      name  => Lucy
      age   => 22
      sex   => female

2 =>  id    => 5
      name  => Laura
      age   => 44
      sex   => female

3 =>  id    => 6
      name  => Mike
      age   => 22
      sex   => male

4 =>  id    => 7
      name  => Chris
      age   => 18
      sex   => female


Using Where

If you want to narrow your selection, you will need to add where
conditions to your object. To do this use:

$db->addWhere(column_name, value, operator, conjuction, group)

column name - the column table you want to match against.

value       - the value to compare the column against

operator    - how to compare the column to the value. This
              defaults to equal (=).

conj        - the conjuction between where conditions
	      AND or OR with AND being the default

group       - the group to file this where


Here are some conditional statement and how they would be executed:

Where the id is equal to 4
$db->addWhere('id', 4);

Where the id is equal to 4 or 5
$db->addWhere('id', 4);
$db->addWhere('id', 5, '=', 'or');
note: the above could also be:
$db->addWhere('id', 5, NULL 'or');

Where the age is greater than 20 and less than 45.
$db->addWhere('age', 20, '>');
$db->addWhere('age', 45, '<', 'and');

Grouping conditionals allow proper ordering:

Where the id is greater than 3 and less than 6 OR
the name starts with the letter 'L'
$db->addWhere('id',    3,  '>'); 
$db->addWhere('id',    6,  '<');// AND is the default operator

$db->addWhere('name', 'L%', 'like', NULL, 'namegroup');
// since the above is the only item in the group, the operator is 
// not important
 
$db->setGroupConj('namegroup', 'or');
// the default is AND, so I user setGroupConj to change to OR


Kind of complicated but it would look like this if you wrote the
query.

SELECT mytable.*
FROM mytable
WHERE ( mytable.id > '3' AND mytable.id < '6' )
OR ( mytable.name LIKE 'L%' )


You also have the option of sending your own 'where' string to the
object using setQWhere():

// the conj defaults to 'AND' so you can leave it blank if you wish
$conj = 'or'; 

$db->setQWhere("(id > 3 AND id < 6) OR (name LIKE 'L%'", $conj);

You can use this function if having problems using the addWhere
function.




Ordering
If we wanted to select in a certain order we use the addOrder
function:
$db->addOrder(columnname_direction);

For example, if we wanted the list in reverse order by name:
$db->addOrder('name desc');

If we wanted it the next ordering element to be age in ascending
order:
$db->addOrder('age asc');


Setting columns
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Normally, the select function will grab all the columns from a
table. You may not want this. If this is the case then you need to
specify which columns to grab using the addColumn function.

$db->addColumn(column_name, max_min, as, count, distinct);

So if I wanted to only receive the 'name' column in my result:
$db->addColumn('name');

I can keep adding columns that I want to receive as well:
$db->addColumn('age');

If I want the maximum amount of a column (in this case the name last
in the alphabet)
$db->addColumn('name', FALSE, 'max');

Minimum would be:
$db->addColumn('name', FALSE, 'min');

If you want the result referenced under a different name, you can use
the 'as' column.

$db->addColumn('name', null, 'patient_last_name');


If 'count' is true, the column will be surrounded by the
COUNT() function:

// Query: select count(name) from table
$db->addColumn('name', null, null, true);

If 'distinct' is true, the column will be wrapped by a distinct
function call.

// Query: select name column without repeats
$db->addColumn('name', null, null, false, true);



Note that when you do not set any columns, a select query will default
to a 'get all' query or in sql terms 'SELECT * FROM table_name'
As soon as you set a column, the database object will NO LONGER call
'*', this includes adding a column from a joined table.

Joining table Queries
----------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, the database works on one table. You may however retrieve
the results using more than one.

For example, say I want to get the last name of someone whose first
name is 'Ted' in table1 and who is over 30 years old in table2. I want
to also make sure the id columns from table1 and table2 match.

$db = & new PHPWS_DB('table1');
$db->addColumn('lastname');


$db->addWhere('firstname', 'Ted');
// notice I put the table name in the column parameter
$db->addWhere('table2.age', '30', '>');
$db->addWhere('table2.id', 'table1.id');

$result = $db->select();

This is the equivalent of:

SELECT table1.lastname FROM table1, table2
WHERE ( table1.firstname = 'ted' AND
        table2.age > '30' AND
        table2.id = table1.id 
      )

Note that when you use extra tables, the do NOT show results by
default. If you want to see the results joined together, you need to
use addColumn like so:
(see addColumn below for more information)


$db->addColumn('table2.age');

Which is equivalent to:
SELECT table1.lastname, table2.age FROM table1, table2
WHERE ( table1.firstname = 'Ted' AND
        table2.age > '30' AND
	table2.id = table1.id 
      )

Use 'table2.*' to get all the column results.


If you need to join the results of two columns to one table, you can
reference a table with a new name.

For example:

table1
ownername | pet_id_1  | pet_id_2
---------------------------------
  matt    |     2     |    1

table2
  id    |   title
---------------------
   1    | Cat
   2    | Dog

I want the ownername plus the pet type joined from each column.

First I create a database object:

$db = new PHPWS_DB('table1');

Next I add two tables with the second parameter naming the table
reference.
Note: you MUST add/name the tables before accessing them in column or
where

$db->addTable('table2', 'pet1');
$db->addTable('table2', 'pet2');

Now, using the new table names, I grab columns I want to see
$db->addColumn('table1.ownername');

I need to give the next two different names so I don't get two 'title'
columns.

$db->addColumn('pet1.title', null, 'first_pet');
$db->addColumn('pet2.title', null, 'second_pet');

Now I can use the join elements of where:

$db->addWhere('table1.pet_id_1', 'pet1.id');
$db->addWhere('table1.pet_id_2', 'pet2.id');

$result = $db->select();

The result should be:

ownername  |   first_pet  | second_pet 
--------------------------------------
matt       |     Dog      |    Cat


Advanced joins
----------------------------------------------------------------
Database also contains a addJoin function. It facilitates inner/outer
left/right joins. Using the same settings from above, we'll just
addJoin.


$db = new PHPWS_DB('table1');
$db->addTable('table2', 'pet1');
$db->addTable('table2', 'pet2');
$db->addColumn('table1.ownername');
$db->addColumn('pet1.title', null, 'first_pet');
$db->addColumn('pet2.title', null, 'second_pet');

// left, left inner, right, etc.
$join_type = 'left';
$join_from = 'table1';
$join_to_1   = 'pet1';
$join_to_2   = 'pet2';
$join_on_1 = 'pet_id_1';
$join_on_2 = 'pet_id_2';

$db->addJoin($join_type,$join_from,$join_to_1,$join_on_1,$join_on_2);
$db->addJoin($join_type,$join_from,$join_to_2,$join_on_1,$join_on_2);

In this case I would get the same results except now I first_pet and
second_pet can be null if the ids don't join.


Limiting results
----------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to control how many results you receive, use the setLimit
function.
$db->setLimit(amount);

So if I only want 2 rows returned:
$db->setLimit(2);

Receiving the select data
Now that we have set some parameters, we now can call the select()
function to pass our data to a variable. In most cases, this data will
be returned as an array.

The 'type' parameter of select allows you to alter the format of the
result as well. Here are the choices:

all
This is the default case. It will return all the columns specified in
an array. If you set columns, only they will be returned.

assoc
This case uses the PEAR getAssoc function. You may try to use this
function but it does different things depending on how results are
returned. Be careful.

col
This case returns just one column from a query. You will need to
choose a column to return by using the addColumn() function. If the
column is not set, select() will return the first column in the table.
The column will not be an associative array.

min / max
These cases will return the minimum or maximum result
respectively. This value will be a string. Like the 'col' case, you
will need to use addColumn to specify which result column you want.

one
In this case, you expect just one result. This result will be a
string.

row
This case returns an associate array for just one row from the table.

Indexing the result

Sometimes you want a database result indexed for easier
manipulation. To do so, you can use the setIndexBy() function.

For example, if you were to run our previous select
statement with the index set to use the 'id' column:

$db->setIndexBy('id');

The result would look like the following:

3 =>  id    => 3
      name  => Chris
      age   => 33
      sex   => male
      
4 =>  id    => 4
      name  => Lucy
      age   => 22
      sex   => female

5 =>  id    => 5
      name  => Laura
      age   => 44
      sex   => female

6 =>  id    => 6
      name  => Mike
      age   => 22
      sex   => male

7 =>  id    => 7
      name  => Chris
      age   => 18
      sex   => female


If you choose to index by a column that is repeated, the
select with create a sorted array within that result. For example:

$db->setIndexBy('age');

would return:
33 =>  id    => 3
       name  => Chris
       age   => 33
       sex   => male
      
22 =>  0 =>  id    => 4
             name  => Lucy
             age   => 22
             sex   => female

       1 =>  id    => 6
             name  => Mike
             age   => 22
             sex   => male

44 =>  id    => 5
       name  => Laura
       age   => 44
       sex   => female

18 =>  id    => 7
       name  => Chris
       age   => 18
       sex   => female


Setting the Mode
Normally, the select function will return the results as an
associative array. You may also receive the results in an ordered
format or as objects.

$db->setMode('ordered');
or
$db->setMode('object');


Returning results as objects
If your table columns are named the same as a class's, you can change
your result into an array of objects (or just one).

Instead of the select function use the getObjects function.

$db->getObjects(classname);

For example, say I had a class named "friend" and I wanted to grab the
results from the 'friends' database object we made earlier.

$result = $db->getObjects("friend");

Now I will have an array of 'friend' objects. If I wanted to create
just one object from my query, I would use use the loadObject function instead.

$friend = & new Friend;
$db->addWhere("id", 5);
$result = $db->loadObject($friend);

You can use many of the same parameters (where, order, indexby) that
you used for select.

Make sure that you require the class file before you try to make
objects from it. You could also have Database require the class only
if it finds results using the loadClass function.

Example:  $db->loadClass('module_title', 'Class_File.php');

GetObjects can take extra parameters that you wish to pass to the
constructor. For example if the class constructor looked like so:

class friend($last_accessed, $when) {
...
}

You could send the last_accessed and when variable like this:

$result = $db->getObjects('friend', 'sam', mktime());

Keep in mind that the constructor will be called before the variables
are filled in.


Insert

The insert function adds a new row to the database. The options you
need to set are few.

First create your db object as discussed above. Then start adding
values to it. For example, say we want to add a new friend.

$db->addValue("name", "Doug");
$db->addValue("age", "26");
$db->addValue("sex", "male");

You could also add the values via an array:

$values['name'] = "Doug";
$values['age'] = 26;
$values['sex'] = "male";

$db->addValue($values);

Finally, call the insert function:
$result = $db->insert();

You may have noticed that I did not set the id value. That is because
the insert function does that automatically.

In phpWebSite, the database class classifies any column that is named
"id", is the primary key, and is an integer as the main index. It will
automatically increment the id for you.

Normally, the insert function returns TRUE if the insert was
successful (a PEAR error object if not). If the insert function
locates an index, it will return the new id instead. So in the example
above, the result would be the last id plus one: 8.

Update

The update function changes the values of a table row. You only need
to addValue to the columns that require change. For example, let's say
we got Doug's sex wrong (poor Doug, saddled with such a masculine
name).

$db->addValue("sex", "female");

We also need to make sure we update the correct record. So we need to
specify which record to update using addWhere.

$db->addWhere("id", 8);

Finally we call the update function:
$db->update();

If you do not set the where statement, ALL rows will be updated.


saveObject
Just as there is a function to load objects, there is one to save them
as well:

$db->saveObject(object, strip_character);

So let's say we wanted to save one of the 'friend' objects we have
edited.

$db->saveObject($friend);

This will update the table if the where values are set in the database
object. If the where values are not set, a new row will be inserted.

If your object is using underscores as the first character for all
your variables and your table columns do not, you can set
strip_character to TRUE to have them removed.

Also saveObject will not save variables that do not have a
corresponding column name.


Delete
The delete function removes a row from a database table. Let's say
Doug was offended at getting her sex wrong and she is no longer my
friend.

$db->addWhere("id", 8);
$db->delete();

The row is removed from the database.

Like update, if you do not use addWhere, all rows will be deleted from
the database. Be VERY careful.

Note: addOrder and setLimit are not supported at this time for delete
and update. We will readdress this when MySQL 4.0 becomes standard.


Reseting the Object
At times you may want to reset some of your objects settings so that
you can reuse it. Here are the functions you can call and what they
clear in your object:

resetTable
Resets the table. You could also just use setTable.

resetWhere
Clears the where clauses.

resetOrder
Clears the orders.

resetValues
Clears the values.

resetLimit
Clears the limit.

resetColumns
Clears the columns.

reset
Clears the where clauses, the values, the limit, the orders, the
columns, the index by value, and the QWhere value. The table stays intact.


Table functions
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The database class has a few other functions to help you alter or
review the structure of the table it was assigned.

getTableColumns
If you need a listing table columns, use the this function.

$result = $db->getTableColumns();

It will return a listing of the column names in an array.


isTableColumn
Returns TRUE is the column sent to it exists in the table.

if ($db->isTableColumn('name'))
   echo "Name is found!";
else
   echo "Oh oh! Name column is missing!";


dropTable
The removes the currently assigned table from the database.

$db->dropTable();


createTable
This function creates a table. After your database object has been
created, simply add the columns using addValue. DO NOT use addColumn
for this process.

$db = new PHPWS_DB("new_table");
$db->addValue("id", "INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY");
$db->addValue("message", " TEXT NOT NULL");
$db->addValue("allow_view", "SMALLINT NOT NULL");

$db->createTable();

Make sure you put the primary key in the addValue statement.


addTableColumn
This function helps to add one column to the table.

$db->addTableColumn(column_name, column_parameters, after);

Here is an example of adding a new column to our friends table:

$db->addTableColumn("favorite_food", "varchar(50) NULL", "name");

This would create the column right after the 'name' column. If the
'after' parameter is left blank, the column will be placed at the end
of the table. If the 'after' parameter is sent the word 'first' then
it will place the column at the beginning of the table.


dropTableColumn
Removes a column from the table.

$db->dropTableColumn(column_name);

To remove the favorite_food column.
$db->dropTableColumn('favorite_food');



Transactions
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The database class has basic transaction support. Transactions are
processed with three functions: begin, commit, and rollback.



$db = new PHPWS_DB('table1');
$db2 = new PHPWS_DB('table2');

/**
 * The begin function starts the transation. PHPWS_DB will ignore
 * subsequent begin calls until the current transation is committed or
 * rolled back
 */
PHPWS_DB::begin();

$id = (int)$_POST['name_id'];

$db2->addColumn('first_name');
$db2->addWhere('id', $id);
$name = $db2->select('one');

$db2->delete();
$db->addValue('name', $name);
$result = $db->update();

if (!PEAR::isError($result)) {
   /*
    * commit finishes the transaction
    */
   PHPWS_DB::commit();
} else {
   /*
    * rollback returns the tables to their previous status
    *
   PHPWS_DB::rollback();
}

-- Note: MySQL tables must be using the InnoDB table type. If a table --
-- is not, it will IGNORE transaction queries.                        --
