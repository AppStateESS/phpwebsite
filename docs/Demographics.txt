Demographics Module
by Matthew McNaney
---------------------------------------------------

Version 1.0
First draft. Demographics is still a fledgling module. For now, I will
cover the basic functionality. The hooks into the User authentication
are not in the first version.


Introduction
--------------------------------------------------
The Demographics module prevents the replication of user information
across several modules.


Registering your Module
--------------------------------------------------
When your module is installed, Demographics will look for a file named
"demographics.php" in your module's boost directory. The file should
appear like the following example from Comments:
// default fields used
$default[] = 'contact_email';
$default[] = 'website';

Default fields are from the mod/demographics/inc/defaults.php
file. Try not to repeat them. If you need information not listed in
the defaults list, then you can add fields like so:


$fields['avatar']['limit']    = 255; // small graphic of user
$fields['signature']['limit'] = 255; // graphic or saying from user

When creating your own fields, keep two settings in mind.
The 'limit' setting is used for text/string fields. Whatever number
you set will be the maximum size allowed for that field.

When using such a field, you do not need to set the type. If you are
using an integer/number field then you should set it like so:
$fields['longitude']['type'] = 'integer';

Integer fields do not have a limit setting.

Add as many default and custom fields as you need.

Creating a Demographics User Object
--------------------------------------------------
User information is accessed via the Demographics_User class.

PHPWS_Core::initModClass('demographics', 'Demographics_User.php');

The Demographics User does not stand alone. You need to extend it:

class my_object extends Demographics_User {
...
}

Once extended, you select which demographic fields you are going to
access by declaring them as object vars:

class my_object extends Demographics_User {
    var $first_name;
}

Here is what Comment's class looks like:
class Comment_User extends Demographics_User {
    var $display_name  = NULL; // this is copied from the user class
    var $signature     = NULL; // newly created field
    var $comments_made = 0;    // not part of demographics
    var $joined_date   = 0;    // copied from user class
    var $avatar        = NULL; // newly created field
    var $contact_email = NULL; // default demographics field
    var $website       = NULL; // default demographics field
    var $location      = NULL; // not part of demographics
    var $locked        = 0;

    // using a second table with demographics
    var $_table        = 'comments_users';
...

As you can see we have a combination of default demographic fields,
newly created fields, and variables used specifically within comments.


Loading an User's Demographics
---------------------------------------------------
Your constructor should call the "load" function from the parent
class. Here is another example from comments:

 function Comment_User($user_id=NULL)
    {
        if ($user_id == 0) {
            $this->loadAnonymous();
            return;
        }
        $this->user_id = (int)$user_id;
        $this->load();
    }


Ignore the loadAnonymous function. It is specific to comments.
Take a look at the rest of the constructor. First we set the object's
user_id variable. The load function then pulls the user's current
information from the demographic's table.

Demographics will also look for a _table variable in the class. If
found, it will suppliment its data. The extra table needs only to have
a user_id column. Demographics will take care of saving and removing
data to and from this table as well.


Saving a User's Demographics
--------------------------------------------------
Once you have verified and set each variable in your object, call the
"save" function. Demographics will take care of the rest. Make sure
you parse the data going into Demographics, as it doesn't do any
parsing on its own.
