Translating your module using gettext

phpWebSite uses the gettext utilities recommended by GNU.

This document should help you get started. Special thanks to Joao
Prado Maia for writing a very helpful tutorial on OnLamp.

Before attempting to use gettext, please make sure that you have
gettext compiled on your web server. You must have gettext enabled in
PHP as well.


Getting started
---------------------------------------------------------------------

As you are writing, you will need to indicate which code portions need
translating. You do this with the dgettext function:

echo dgettext('mymod', 'Hello World!');

"mymod" would be the name of your module. This lets phpWebSite know
where to find you translation file.

Please take time to read some rules about using gettext here:
http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/gettext_15.html#SEC15

Sometimes you may have to put some variables in your text. While it
may be tempting to use '$', don't. Instead use printf or sprintf.

Example:

$content = sprintf(dgettext('mymod', 'Hello %s! You have logged in %d times!'),
	           $name, $logged_times);

If you have multiple variables of the same type, use this format:

$content = sprintf(dgettext('mymod', 'Hello %1$s! Your ranking is %2$s!'),
	           $name, $ranking);

This format maintains the variable association. If you used the
following:

$content = sprintf(dgettext('mymod', 'Hello %s! Your ranking is %s!'),
	           $name, $ranking);

and it was translated with the ranking portion first, then your
sentence would get scrambled.


Creating Translation Files
-------------------------------------------
First we need to create a 'po' file. This file is simply a text file
that is later compiled into a 'mo' file. The 'mo' file is read by php
to exchange what you originally wrote into another language.

To create our po file, we will use xgettext

xgettext testing.php

This would create a message file for just the testing.php file.

xgettext *.php

This would create a message file for all the files in the current
directory ending in php.

However, since there can be many files through different directories,
it might be easier to just create a list of files to translate.

grep -lr --include='*.php' 'gettext' * > translate_list.txt

Open the list and make sure the file list looks correct. Now run
xgettext against it. Make sure you run the list from where it was
created. If you don't the file locations will be incorrect.

xgettext -s --no-location --language=PHP -f translate_list.txt

A couple of switches were added here:

-s              : sorts the translation alphabetically 
--no-location   : doesn't list the file and line number of the
                  translation. Although harder to locate, easier for
                  translators to see updates via diffs. The
                  alternative and default value is -n or --add_location.
--language= PHP : tells xgettext that we are parsing a php
                  file. Gettext can usually detect but might as well
                  force.
 
 -f             : tell xgettext to get the file names from our translate_list.txt
                  file

Once your messages.po (or source.po) file is created successfully. You
need to rename it so phpWebSite can see it. Change the po file to
match your module's name. For example, if you module is name "foobar",
rename messages.po to foobar.po.

Next, we need to create a home for your new po file. Go into your
module directory. Now make the following directory:

locale/[language]/LC_MESSAGES/

The [language] is the 2 to 5 letter code for what language the module
was written in. For example, I write my code in English, so I would
use:

locale/en_US/LC_MESSAGES/

Now copy your renamed messages file to that directory.

Congratulations, you have just made your module internationally
compatible!


Translating the your module
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The messages file has an id and a blank translation for every string
you marked in your code. If a translation is blank, gettext will just
return the original phrase. So if dgettext('mymod', 'Hello') is left blank for a
particular language, then "Hello" is what you will see.

If I didn't create my translation file, then, obviously, all my
translations are blank. Therefore, the user will once again see the
original text.

Long story short, you don't need to translate your own module into the
language it was written in. However, creating an untranslated file for
future translators to copy would probably be appreciated.

If you want to translate the module for your language, create or copy
the po file. Now you need to edit the file. There are several editors
that facilitate translation. Emacs has a setting. Kbabel, which comes
with KDE is probably the more intuitive choice.

Open the message.po file in your editor. You will be shown the
original string. The translation will be below it. Type in your 
translation.

Once you are satified with your translations, save the file. Now you
need to ready the file for the gettext program, which does not
actually use the text po file.

msgfmt messages.po

The 'msgfmt' program will create a message.mo file. Put this file in
the proper locale directory and phpWebSite is ready to be translated.


Updating Language Files
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Use msgmerge like so:

msgmerge old_messages_file.po messages.po --output-file=new_messages_file.po

Translations will then be made on the new_messages_file and then
complied. The compiled .mo file must still be named message.mo.
