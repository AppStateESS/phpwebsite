Form Class by Matthew McNaney

Version History

0.1 First draft April 20, 2006


Introduction
------------------------------

The PHPWS_Form class assists developers in the creation and display of
web forms.

Forms are made up of elements (text areas, check boxes, radio buttons,
etc.). After constructing a form object, you add these elements and
their properties individually. You complete can then complete the
process calling the getTemplate function. The result can then be sent
to phpWebSite's Template class for display.



Getting Started
------------------------------
First construct a form object.

$form = & new PHPWS_Form('form_name');

The 'form_name' is not required but you may need it should you have
multiple forms on a single page. The default name is 'phpws_form'.


Adding Elements
------------------------------
Each element is added using the 'add' function. If you developed for
phpWebSite versions 0.10.x and under, this may be familiar:

$form->add('name_of_element', 'type_of_element', 'value_of_element');

In phpWebSite 1.x and higher, you may find it easier to use the
element type add functions instead.

Here are the element types:

text | textfield
textarea
submit
button
password
file
select | dropbox
multiple
radio | radiobutton
check | checkbox
hidden

Here are the element type add functions
addText | addTextField
addTextarea
addSubmit
addButton
addPassword
addFile
addSelect | addDropbox
addMultiple
addRadio | addRadioButton
addCheck | addCheckBox
addHidden

With the element type functions, you just need the element name and
value.

Element Description
--------------------------------------------
The following is a description of each element, how it's value is
used, and an example of how it would display. Please note that for
clarity and brevity, some attributes are not shown in the examples.


text | text field 
Creates an single-line input type "text". The text field displays the
value as the default text.

// <input type="text" name="pet" value="dog" />
$form->addText('pet', 'dog'); 


textarea
Creates a multiple-line "textarea" input. The text area displays the
value as the default text.

// <textarea name="pet_story">Type story here...</textarea>
$form->addTextarea('pet_story', 'Type story here...'); 


submit
Creates an input type "submit" button. This button submits the form it
is contained within. The value displays on the button face and is
passed to the form when clicked.

// <input type="submit" name="create_report" value="Create report" />
$form->addSubmit('create_report', 'Create report');

Most of the time, a form only has _one_ submit button. As such, this
function lets you only enter one parameter. If you do so, the name of
the submit button becomes simply 'submit'.

// <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Create report" />
$form->addSubmit('Create report');

The above ONLY works with "addSubmit" NOT with the "add" function.



button
Creates an input type "button". Value displays on the button
face. Clicking the button does not submit the form.

// <input type="button" name="check_all" value="Check all boxes" />
$form->addButton('check_all', 'Check all boxes');

Button works like submit in regards to only needing one parameter. The
default name for the button however is "button" not "submit". Like
submit you MUST use "addButton" and not the "add" function.



password
Creates an input type "password". The value displays as hidden
characters (usually "*******") in the password text box. The password
itself IS viewable in the HTML source.

//<input type="password" name="user_password" value="" />
$form->addPassword('user_password');

Note: as a security measure, the password will NOT display by default
unless the allowValue function is called like so:

//<input type="password" name="user_password" value="qwerty" />
$form->addPassword('user_password', 'qwerty');
$form->allowValue('user_password');



file
Creates a text field and Browse button for the uploading of client
files. Value is ignored.
// <input type="file" name="upload" value="" />
$form->addFile('upload');


select | dropbox
Creates a drop-down selector. Only one selection may be made per
element, unlike the multiple element described below. The value passed
to this element must be an array. Each row in the array, is an
option. The array row's key is used as the option's "value". The
element displays an array row's value as the option's content.

Example:
$sex = array('m' => 'Male', 'f' => 'Female');
$form->addSelect('sex', $sex);

Displays:
<select name="sex">
  <option value="m">Male</option>
  <option value="f">Female</option>
</select>


multiple
Creates a multiple select drop-down. As the name implies, the user may
choose multiple items in the list. Other than this difference, the
parameters and functionality is identical to the "select" element.

Example:
$toppings = array('pr' => 'Pepperoni', 'm' => 'Mushrooms', 'yuck' => 'Anchovies');
$form->addMultiple('toppings', $toppings);

Displays:
<select name="toppings" multiple="multiple">
  <option value="pr">Pepperoni</option>
  <option value="m">Mushrooms</option>
  <option value="yuck">Anchovies</option>
</select>

"select" and "multiple" also handle matches differently. See the
"Setting Matches" information later in this document.


radio | radiobutton
Creates an input type "radio" selector. Like the "multiple" element,
the radio value is an array. Unlike "multiple", the array is not
associative. The key of each array row is irrelevant, only the value
is used.

$beverage = array('pepsi', 'milk', 'h2o');
$form->addRadio('beverage', $beverage);

Displays:
<input type="radio" name="beverage" value="pepsi" />
<input type="radio" name="beverage" value="milk" />
<input type="radio" name="beverage" value="h20" />

Note: if you were looking at this in a browser, it would like this
(with the zero representing a radio button):

0 0 0

To get this:

0 Pepsi
0 Milk
0 Water

You would need to set the button's label (and add breaks in the
template). That is covered in the "Setting Labels" section.

Update: You can send an associative array if you use addRadioAssoc
instead.

$beverage = array('pepsi'=>'Pepsi-Cola', 'milk'=>'Moo Juice',
                  'h20'=>'Water');
$form->addRadioAssoc('beverage', $beverage);

This function will send the keys to addRadio and the values to
setLabel.


check | checkbox
Creates an input type "checkbox".

// <input type="checkbox" name="married" value="yes" />
$form->addCheck('married', 'yes');

Unlike other elements, this element can receive either a string as a
value (the most common occurence) OR an array.

Use an array value for multiple checkboxes within the same element
name:

$foods = array('fried_chicken', 'pizza', 'ice_cream', 'hot_dogs', 'clams');
$form->addCheck('favorite_foods', $foods);

Displays:

<input type="checkbox" name="favorite_foods[fried_chicken]" value="fried_chicken" />
<input type="checkbox" name="favorite_foods[pizza]" value="pizza" />
<input type="checkbox" name="favorite_foods[ice_cream]" value="ice_cream" />
<input type="checkbox" name="favorite_foods[hot_dogs]" value="hot_dogs" />
<input type="checkbox" name="favorite_foods[clams]" value="clams" />

If you use an array value, make sure to use a standard array (not
associative) with natural key progression (i.e. 0,1,2,3, etc.). The form class may get
confused otherwise.

Note: Like the radio button above, you need to set the labels for the
text next to the check box.

Update: You can send an associative array if you use addCheckAssoc
instead.

$beverage = array('pepsi'=>'Pepsi-Cola', 'milk'=>'Moo Juice',
                  'h20'=>'Water');
$form->addCheckAssoc('beverage', $beverage);

This function will send the keys to addCheck and the values to
setLabel.


hidden
Creates an input of type "hidden".

// <input type="hidden" name="current_id" value="4" />
$form->addHidden('current_id', 4);

Hidden inputs do not actually display in your form but are passed on
when submitted.


Setting Labels (and the element Title)
----------------------------------------
Without labels, users won't know what they should be typing,
selecting, or checking. Labels identify an elements function. Setting
labels in not required, but using the "setLabel" is quite useful for a
few reasons.

First, setLabels links the descriptive text to the id of the
element. This direct link enables extra browser usability. For
example, you can click a checkbox's label as well as the check box 
itself to select it.

Second, you can translate the label outside of the template.

There are other reasons you will find on your own (code readibility,
repeating template rows, etc.).

Setting a label is simple. Just use the name of your element and the
label text.

$form->addText('username');
$form->setLabel('username', 'Enter your username');

This will display:
<label for="phpws_form_username">Enter your username</label>
<input type="text" name="username" id="phpws_form_username" title="Enter your username" value="" />

Notice the "for" attribute: phpws_form_username. Now look at the
input's id. They are the same. This is the linking I refered to
earlier.

The id value is a combination of the form (remember the default form name is
'phpws_form') and the element's name.

Also notice the text input's title attribute. Normally if we did not
set the label, the title would be the element's name. The title will
usually appear when a user mouses over the input element. You can set
the title yourself by using the setTitle function.

$form->setTitle('username', 'The username field');

You would then get the below instead: 
<input type="text" name="username" id="phpws_form_username"
    title="The username field" value="" />


To add labels to multi-valued elements, just set the label with an
array:

$foods = array('fried_chicken', 'pizza', 'ice_cream', 'hot_dogs', 'clams');
$food_labels = array('Fried Chicken', 'Gooey Pizza', 'Ice Cream', 'Foot Long Hot Dogs', 'Fried Clams');
$form->addCheck('favorite_foods', $foods);
$form->setLabel('favorite_foods', $food_labels);

The order of the label array must match the value order.

Here is an example of radio button labels:

$beverage = array('pepsi', 'milk', 'h2o');
$bev_label = array('Pepsi', 'Milk', 'Water');
$form->addRadio('beverage', $beverage);
$form->setLabel('beverage', $bev_label);

Single and multiple select elements do not need multiple labels. One
label defines the whole select element.



Matching elements
---------------------------------------------
When using check boxes, radio buttons, and selects (multiple and
single) you often need to set default values. In PHPWS_Form, this is
done with the "setMatch" function.

Single matches
Check boxes with one value, radio buttons, and single selects use one
value for matching. Here are some examples using earlier samples:

Check boxes

$form->addCheck('married', 'yes');
$form->setMatch('married', 'yes');

Displays
<input type="checkbox" name="married" value="yes" checked="checked" />


Single select

$sex = array('m' => 'Male', 'f' => 'Female');
$form->addSelect('sex', $sex);
$form->setMatch('sex', 'm');

Displays
<select name="sex">
   <option value="m" selected="selected">Male</option>
   <option value="f">Female</option>
</select>


Radio buttons

$beverage = array('pepsi', 'milk', 'h2o');
$form->addRadio('beverage', $beverage);
$form->setMatch('beverage', 'milk');

<input type="radio" name="beverage" value="pepsi" />
<input type="radio" name="beverage" value="milk" checked="checked" />
<input type="radio" name="beverage" value="h2o" />


Multiple Matches
Multiple check boxes and multiple selects use an array for matching.

Check boxes

$foods      = array('fried_chicken', 'pizza', 'ice_cream', 'hot_dogs', 'clams');
$food_match = array('pizza', 'clams');
$form->addCheck('favorite_foods', $foods);
$form->setMatch('favorite_foods', $food_match);

<input type="checkbox" name="favorite_foods[fried_chicken]" value="fried_chicken" />
<input type="checkbox" name="favorite_foods[pizza]" value="pizza" checked="checked" />
<input type="checkbox" name="favorite_foods[ice_cream]" value="ice_cream" />
<input type="checkbox" name="favorite_foods[hot_dogs]" value="hot_dogs" />
<input type="checkbox" name="favorite_foods[clams]" value="clams" checked="checked" />


Multiple select

$toppings = array('pr' => 'Pepperoni', 'm' => 'Mushrooms', 'yuck' => 'Anchovies');
$top_match = array('m', 'yuck');
$form->addMultiple('toppings', $toppings);
$form->setMatch('toppings', $top_match);

<select name="toppings[]" multiple="multiple">
   <option value="pr">Pepperoni</option>
   <option value="m" selected="selected">Mushrooms</option>
   <option value="yuck" selected="selected">Anchovies</option>
</select>


Optgroups
--------------------------------------
Optgroups define a set of options in a single or multiple select form
element. The form class allows some limited optgroup capabilities.

$form = new PHPWS_Form;

// The list of elements for the select element
$produce = array( 'apple'=>'Apple',
                  'grapes'=>'Grapes',
                  'strawberry'=>'Strawberries',
                  'celery'=>'Celery',
                  'carrot'=>'Carrot'
                );

$form->addSelect('produce', $produce);

// The first parameter is the element I want to add the optGroup to.
// The second parameter tells form which element starts the group
// The last parameter is the group's label
$form->setOptgroup('produce', 'apple', 'Fruit');
$form->setOptgroup('produce', 'celery', 'Vegetable');

$result = $form->getTemplate();

echo implode('', $result);

Here is the output
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<form class="phpws-form" id="phpws_form" action="index.php" method="post">
<div>
<select name="produce" id="phpws_form_produce" >
<optgroup label="Fruit">
<option value="apple">Apple</option>
<option value="grapes">Grapes</option>
<option value="strawberry">Strawberries</option>
</optgroup>
<optgroup label="Vegetable">
<option value="celery">Celery</option>
<option value="carrot">Carrot</option>
</optgroup>
</select>
</div>
</form>

You can also use setOptgroup on a multiple form element:

$form->addMultiple('produce', $produce);
$form->setOptgroup('produce', 'apple', 'Fruit');
$form->setOptgroup('produce', 'celery', 'Vegetable');

setOptgroup will fail on any other type of element.


Creating your template
---------------------------------------
Once you have plugged in all your form elements, you can call the
"getTemplate" function.

$template = $form->getTemplate();

The template variable is an associative array. To get your final form
content, you just need to send it to PHPWS_Template:

$content = PHPWS_Template::process($template, 'my_module_title',
                                   'template_file.tpl');


You can now display the result of the process function.

If you are unsure how templates work in phpWebSite, please read
template.txt in the docs directory.

Now you are ready to create your form template.

Two tags frame your template module: START_FORM and
END_FORM. All other form tags should appear between these two tags.

The other form tags are derived from your form element names. For
example:

$form->addHidden('command', 'save_pet');
$form->addText('pet');

To display this text field we just need to add a "pet" tag.

{START_FORM}

{PET}

{END_FORM}

Notice that all the tags are capitalized. This is done
automatically. Make sure you don't have two form elements named the
same with only differences in case. (e.g. my_variable vs. My_Variable:
MY_VARIABLE will be the tag).

Notice that we do not have a tag for the "command" hidden element. All
hidden elements are included in the START_FORM tag. Since they are
never seen, there is no reason to have tags in the template for hidden
variables.

Now lets add a label:

$form->setLabel('pet', "Your pet's name");

We just need to append the form tag with "_LABEL":

{START_FORM}

{PET_LABEL}<br />
{PET}

{END_FORM}

Simple enough. 

The templating gets a little more complicated when you have multiple
valued elements.

Let's look at our radio buttons example:

$beverage = array('pepsi', 'milk', 'h2o');
$bev_label = array('Pepsi', 'Milk', 'Water');
$form->addRadio('beverage', $beverage);
$form->setMatch('beverage', 'milk');
$form->setLabel('beverage', $bev_label);

Here is the example setup:

{START_FORM}

<ul style="list-style : none">
<li>{BEVERAGE_1} {BEVERAGE_1_LABEL}</li>

<li>{BEVERAGE_2} {BEVERAGE_2_LABEL}</li>

<li>{BEVERAGE_3} {BEVERAGE_3_LABEL}</li>
</ul>

{END_FORM}

This will display as:

 0 Pepsi
 0 Milk
 0 Water

Follow the above format for the multiple check box example as well.


Repeating Rows
----------------------------------------
There is another way to display multiple elements. You can use
repeating template rows.

Using the above beverage example, let's add the useRowRepeat function:

$form->useRowRepeat();

Now since we are familiar with row repeats (you're not? go: template.txt),
then this is what our new template looks like:

{START_FORM}

<ul style="list-style : none">

<!-- BEGIN beverage_repeat -->
<li>{BEVERAGE} {BEVERAGE_LABEL}</li>
<!-- END beverage_repeat -->

</ul>

{END_FORM}

The display results will look identical. Using repeating rows is nice
because:
- you don't have to bother with the number suffixes
- your template is cleaner and easier to read
- the number of elements you add to the form can be dynamic.

The last point is important. If our module allowed the admin to add
new beverages, the template example would not work. After the third
beverage, nothing would display. We don't have that problem with
repeating rows.


Are we there yet?
--------------------------------------
If you have read this far, you know enough to start using the form
class. Go to it. The rest of this document covers the auxillary
commands and functions. Read on to unlock the full power of the Form
class! Ok it isn't that impressive, but it does contain some helpful
information.


Auth Keys
--------------------------------------
Every form automatically adds a hidden variable named "authkey". This
allows you use the Current_User::authorized() function.


WYSIWYG
--------------------------------------
Beyond mentioning its existence, we won't discuss the old WYSIWYG in
phpWebSite 0.10.x. The capabilities in 1.x are far more advanced.

Note: Before learning to use the editor, you may want to make sure it
is installed. Please read docs/Editor.php.

Once you have your preferred editor installed, you can access it
within your form.

The editor only works with text areas obviously. To enable it, in your
text area, you just need to call the useEditor function.

$form->addTextarea('my_life_story');
$form->useEditor('my_life_story');

BEWARE: the editors included with phpWebSite _assume_ you are only
using them for administrative functions. Untrusted users should get a
plain text area to prevent excessive markup.



Web Standards, Tabs and Fieldsets
-----------------------------------------
The form class attempts to make all your forms XHTML compliant. Labels
are a major portion of compliance. getTemplate also adds a <div> tag
around your elements to prevent problems with parent - child
relationships.

If you ever have been without a mouse, you probably know how to tab
through a form. Sometimes the tab order is not really intuitive. You
can set this order yourself.

$form->setTab('beverage', 1);
$form->setTab('favorite_foods', 2);


The second parameter determines the tab order. The element's creation
order is irrelevant. Make sure you don't use the same number twice.

Another way to make your forms more compliant, especially on pages
with more than one form, is the use of fieldsets. To automatically
wrap a fieldset around your form call this function:

$form->useFieldset();

The default parameter is true but you have to call the function to
have the fieldset appear. Send false to disable it.

The fieldset replaces the div tag mentioned above.


To add a legend to the fieldset use setLegend:

$form->setLegend('Dinner Form');

Using setLegend automatically turns on the fieldset.


Disable and Read Only Elements
-----------------------------------------
You can set elements to disable and readonly status. Here are the
differences via the W3C
(http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.12)


   * Disabled controls do not receive focus.
   * Disabled controls are skipped in tabbing navigation.
   * Disabled controls cannot be successful.

   * Read-only elements receive focus but cannot be modified by the user.
   * Read-only elements are included in tabbing navigation.
   * Read-only elements may be successful.

The functions are setDisabled and setReadOnly respectively.

$form->addText('example');

$form->setDisabled('example' [,true]);
or
$form->setReadOnly('example' [,true]);

The second parameter turns the condition on (true) or off (false). The
default parameter is TRUE.


Adding Tags
-----------------------------------------------
Before passing a form template to a template file, you may want to add
extra tags. These could consist of titles, instructions, etc. If want
to add the tags before getTemplate is called, use addTplTag:

$form->addTplTag('TITLE', 'Your Dinner Menu Form');
$form->addTplTag('INSTRUCTIONS', 'Please fill out the following form.');

You could also add the tags post getTemplate:

$template = $form->getTemplate();
$template['TITLE'] = 'Your Dinner Menu Form';
$template['INSTRUCTIONS'] = 'Please fill out the following form.';

You can also merge a template array into the form's:

$merge['TITLE'] = 'Your Dinner Menu Form';
$merge['INSTRUCTIONS'] = 'Please fill out the following form.';

$form->mergeTemplate($merge);



Adding "Extra" Information
-------------------------------------------------
If you need to add javascript, class definitions, or some other
attribute to an element, use the setExtra function:

$form->addButton('cancel', 'Cancel');
$form->setExtra('cancel', 'onclick="window.close()"');

$form->addText('pet');
$form->setExtra('pet', 'class="pet-name"');


Dimensions
-------------------------------------------------
Oftentimes you want to control the display text fields and text
areas. There are a few functions that will help you with this.

Sometimes you want to limit the size or maximum amount of characters
in a text field. There are two functions for each limit:

$form->addText('pet');

// The text field will display 50 characters wide
$form->setSize('pet', 50); 

// The text field will only allow 12 characters to be typed
$form->setSize('phone', 12); 

You can set the column and row numbers for text areas like so:

$form->addTextarea('life_story');
$form->setRows('life_story', 10);
$form->setCols('life_story', 40);

Note: Keep in mind, these values are ignored when you use the WYSIWYG
editor

You could also use inline styles (which you shouldn't do but sometimes
it is necessary) with text fields and areas with the setWidth and
setHeight functions:

$form->addText('pet');
$form->setWidth('98%');
$form->setHeight('2em');

If you want to use CSS and classes to stylize a specific element, you
can use the setClass function:

$form->addTextArea('life_story');
$form->setClass('life_story', 'pink-border');


Changing Tag Names
------------------------------------------------
As stated earlier, template tags reflect the element name. If for some
reason you want to use a different tag name, change it using setTag:

$form->addText($something_dynamic);
$form->setTag($something_dynamic, 'first_tag');


Setting the Action and Method
------------------------------------------------
The form class assumes you want to post to the index.php file. If for
some reason you do not, use setAction to change the file name:

$form->setAction('password_check.php');

The form class also assumes you want to use the "post" method on
submission. If you want use the "get" method instead, call setMethod:

$form->setMethod('get');

to change back:

$form->setMethod('post');

Don't worry about the encode method. Form will automatically set it if
an addFile function is called.


Getting one element
-------------------------------------------------
If you want to grab the output for just one element without calling
getTemplate, use the "get" function:

$pet_text_field = $form->get('pet', [,FALSE]);

This would return the input tag for the pet text field. The second
parameter defaults to FALSE. If you send TRUE, you will receive an
array of elements. The 'elements' key contains the input tags. The
'labels' key contains the labels for those elements.


Adding a date form
-------------------------------------------------
Manually creating a drop down list of dates and times is a lengthy
process. The Form class can help you with this process.


// The name given to the form element
$name = 'event_date';

// The date you want the drop downs to match. If set to 0, the current
// date will be used
$date = strtotime('5 March 2004');

// The strftime string format you want to use for the date.
// see http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php
// The default is %B for full month name
$month_format = '%b'; // Abbrevated month name

// Number of years in the past you want the drop down to display
$years_past = 2; //default 1

// Number of years in the future you want the drop down to display
$years_ahead = 10; //default 3


$result = $form->dateSelect($name,
                            $date,
                            $month_format, 
                            $years_past,
                            $years_ahead);

The dateSelect function will create template tags based on your form
element name. You just need to add them to your template. Using
event_date as an example, here would be the resulting tags:

{EVENT_DATE_YEAR}
{EVENT_DATE_MONTH}
{EVENT_DATE_DAY}
{EVENT_DATE_12HOUR}
{EVENT_DATE_24HOUR}
{EVENT_DATE_MINUTE}
{EVENT_DATE_AMPM}

Capturing date form
---------------------------------------------------
If you want the result from a dateSelect posting, call the
getPostedDate function with the form element name to receive the unix
time:

$unix_time = PHPWS_Form::getPostedDate('event_date');

Keep in mind the following:

- 24 hour tag takes precedent over the 12 hour tag.
- You will need the AMPM tag if using the 12 hour tag.
- Any tags not posted are assumed to be of the current time. So if the
  month tag is missing, it will use the current month.

Testing the date
---------------------------------------------------
If you want to check the validity of your posted date (e.g. 31
February), use the testDate function:

if (!PHPWS_Form::testDate('event_date')) {
   echo 'That date does not exist.';
}


Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------
Hopefully you will find the PHPWS_Form class helpful. Remember: you
don't have to use this class to create forms. You can create them
directly in your code or templates if you want. Personally, I find the
Forms class invaluable.
