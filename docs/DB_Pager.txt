DB Pager Documentation by Matthew McNaney
------------------------------------------------------------------

Before version 1.0.0, PhpWebSite had some great paging tools. There
were just two little details that were troublesome.

1) Often you would need to session the class. This created a bit of
   overhead and refresh problems.
2) The pager class would need ALL the results of your data before
   displaying a portion of the results. Either you repeatedly pulled
   all the data at one time or you sessioned the results.
3) The mechanism for employing the pager was complicated.

After working with our Pager class and viewing PEAR's pager class, we
have tried to combine the best of both worlds.

1) You don't need to session the DB Pager object. It is constructed
   per page hit and gets its data from the previous view.
2) The DB Pager pulls ONLY the data information needed per page view.
3) The process is much simpler.

There are a few downsides:

1) If a user leaves the pager to go to another page, it will be reset
   to its original settings. However, if you must have it remember the
   settings from the previous view, you _could_ session the settings.
2) It expects you to use OOP.
3) It expects a specific object/table synchronizing.
4) The pager can only order items with the information it obtains from
   the database.

Getting Started
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need to require the DB Pager class:

PHPWS_Core::initCoreClass('DBPager.php');
or
require_once PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR . 'core/class/DBPager.php';

You will also need to require the 'working class'. This is the object
that is going to hold your row data. I will be using File Cabinet as an
example:

PHPWS_Core::initCoreClass('Image.php');

The File Cabinet uses the image and document class extensively.

Now I need to make my pager object:

$pager = new DBPager('images', 'PHPWS_Image');

The 'images' variable refers to what table to access. The second
parameter 'PHPWS_Image' is the class to construct from the table
information. 


Setting Main Parameters
--------------------------------------------------------------------
There are three main parameters that need to be set for the pager to
function properly: the module, the template, and the link.

Module:
The module that is using the pager. Use the setModule function:

$pager->setModule('filecabinet');


Template:
This is the template that the pager will use to display your data (see
below for template setup information). Use the the setTemplate
function and supply the path below your module's template directory
(just like using PHPWS_Template::process):

$pager->setTemplate('imageList.tpl');


Link:
Pager will check the current url for the correct link. If for some
reason it is having problems, you can set the link manually.

$pager->setLink('index.php?module=filecabinet&amp;action=main&amp;tab=image');


With these parameters set, the pager is ready to get started. It will
pull a number of rows (based on the page limit) from the specified
table. Each of these rows will then be put into an object (1). Each
variable will be put into a template array. This template array will
be run against the row tags in your template. Remember that all the
variables from your object will be in the template but it is up to you
to create the appropriate tags.

Displaying the Page
--------------------------------------------------------------------
To get the data, just call the get function:

$content = $pager->get();

Layout::add($content);

Read on to configure options and get information on setting up your
pager template.


Where Options
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to set restrictions on the table data, you can use the
addWhere function. This function works just like the Database class
function of the same name.

$pager->addWhere('type', 'image/jpeg');

If I entered these parameters, then the pager would only pull the rows
where the 'type' was equal to 'image/jpeg'. The same rules apply to
this function as to Database. You can set groups, set AND or OR, and
use less/greater-than.


Setting the Order
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you wish to set an listing order, use the setOrder function.

$pager->setOrder('column_name', 'direction', $only_if_empty);

For example if you wanted to order by last name from A to Z:

$pager->setOrder('last_name', 'asc');

From Z to A

$pager->setOrder('last_name', 'desc');

If $only_if_empty is set to 'true' (it is false by default), then the
order will ONLY be in effect if a sort option has not been
selected.



Plugging in Page Tags
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to add extra dynamic information to your list template,
you will need to use the addPageTags function. In the below example, I
need to translate the column headers, so I am plugging them into
addTags.

$tags['PAGE_LABEL'] = _('Page');
$tags['TITLE']      = _('Title');
$tags['FILENAME']   = _('Filename');
$tags['MODULE']     = _('Module');
$tags['SIZE']       = _('Size');
$tags['ACTION']     = _('Action');

$pager->addPageTags($tags);


Plugging in Special Row Tags
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to plug in special tags per row, then you can do so using
the addRowTags function.

This function works differently than addPageTags which just required
an array of tags. Row tags have the potential to be different every
iteration. Therefore you need to call them via the object.

$pager->addRowTags('get_row_tags');

This would call a method named 'get_row_tags' on each new object.

$object->get_row_tags();

This function must return an associative array.

class my_object {
      function get_row_tags()
      {
         $template['TITLE'] = $this->getFormatedTitle();
         return $template;
      }

      function getFormatedTitle()
      {
         return strtoupper($this->title);
      }
}

So if the 'title' column is pulled from the table as 'my pets', your
addition of the new row tag would replace it with 'MY PETS'.

Note that you can also add static row tags and conditionals using this
function.

One last note. You can add parameters to addRowTags as well:

$pager->addRowTags('get_row_tags', TRUE, 21, 'clown');

function get_row_tags($likes_chocolate, $age, $occupation) {
...
} 


If you are not using a class objects, another way of changing the row
output is to pipe the information through a function or static method
call. To do so, call addRowFunction:

$pager->addRowFunction('row_func');

This would pass your row variables to the "row_func" function and echo
the resultant array.

function row_func($values) {
   $tpl['TITLE'] = process_title($values['title']);
   return $tpl;
}

You may also call a static method by sending an class and method name
array like so:

$pager->addRowFunction(array('class_name', 'method_name'));

The result from the method should, again, be an associative array
corresponding to your pager template.


Converting the date
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If one of your table columns is in unix time, you can have DBPager
format it for you:

$pager->convertDate($column_name, $format[%c]);

The $column_name is the title of the datetime column. The format
matches the parameters used in the strftime function. The default
value is '%c'.

Keep in mind that dates are formatted BEFORE what is called in
addRowTags. Don't format it twice.


Adding Toggles
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-colored rows are not only boring, they make it more difficult to
match information across the page. To combat this, you need to use the
addToggle function. Here is how you could add red, white, and blue
stripes to your list.

$pager->addToggle('style="background-color : red"');
$pager->addToggle('style="background-color : white"');
$pager->addToggle('style="background-color : blue"');

The pager will alternate between each toggle color as it displays the
rows (2). I recommend, however, that you use toggle css classes.

$pager->addToggle('class="toggle1"');
$pager->addToggle('class="toggle2"');

These are supported in several default themes.


Adding Search
--------------------------------------------------------------------
You can easily add a search text box to your pager.
$pager->setSearch('search_column');

So if I wanted to search among the db table column 'filename' I would
add:
$pager->setSearch('filename');

Each extra parameter sent to setSearch will search an addition column:

$pager->setSearch('filename', 'first_name');

The search form will be visable after you add the SEARCH tag into your
template.


Setting up your template
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you continue, make sure you know how templates work in
phpWebSite(3). 

It is easy to create a custom sort header for a column. Say you wanted
to sort by the table column pet_name:

$pager->addSortHeader('pet_name', 'My Pet Names');

This would create a button/title combo that would sort the pet_name
column. It would look something like this:

[] My Pet Names

You would just need to add "PET_NAME_SORT" to your template.

If you don't use addSortHeader, DBPager will still create a SORT
button without the header text for every column returned from the
database.

After the headers come the actual rows. Notice that the column tag
names are identical to the table column names. The ACTION tag is from
the Special Row Tags section.

<!-- BEGIN listrows -->
  <tr {TOGGLE}>
    <td>{TITLE}</td>
    <td>{FILENAME}</td>
    <td>{MODULE}</td>
    <td>{SIZE}</td>
    <td>{ACTION}</td>   
  </tr>
<!-- END listrows -->

VERY IMPORTANT!!
You must use the listrows commenting. Pager will repeat the rows
within the listrows comments. Without them, you will only see one row.

Finally, you need to include the PAGES and LIMITS tags for page
navigation:

<div align="center">
  <b>{PAGE_LABEL}</b><br />
  {PAGES}<br />
  {LIMITS}
</div>

If you don't like the limit divisions, you may set your own using
setLimitList:

$limits[4]  = 4;
$limits[9]  = 9;
$limits[16] = 16;
$pager->setLimitList($limits);

To choose the default limit use:
$pager->setDefaultLimit(9);

Clicking on the page links will let the user move through the
data. Clicking on the limit links will let the user control how many
rows are displayed on screen at a time.
 
The PAGE_LABEL tag is from the Page Tags section.

Here is a full list of the navigation and information tags.

TOTAL_ROWS    : lists the current page within the total number of pages
PAGE_LABEL    : translated text that says "Page"
PAGES         : listing of pages with page 'turners' on each end
PAGE_DROP     : a drop select box for selecting a specific page
LIMIT_LABEL   : translated text that says "Limit"
LIMITS        : a small list of limit options
SEARCH        : a search box (see Adding Search above)
EMPTY_MESSAGE : if no rows are found, 'No rows found' will appear here
                {You can set this message with $pager->setEmptyMessage($message)



Advanced Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The pager object has uses a database object in the ->db
variable. Normally, you never need alter it, however there may be a
time when you want to mold the pager output.

One instance where I play with the database object is when I want to
include a column from another table.

For example, lets say that I have a category column in my main
table. This integer column references the id of another table. We want
the category title in that table. (Note: this particular example would
be better suited with the joinResult function).

// Ask for the title from the category_table and retrieve it as
// cat_title.
$pager->db->addColumn('category_table.title', NULL, 'cat_title');

// When you add a column, the database class assumes you want only
// that column. So we include a splat (*) as a column on the main
// table as well.
$pager->db->addColumn('main_table.*');

// Here is the where join
$pager->db->addWhere('main_table.category_id', 'category_table.id');

Now when pager pulls with will create a cat_title variable for each
row. Make sure that if you are using item classes with the pager that
you create a variable to hold the extra column.


Advanced Joins
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want the results of a join to appear in your page, you can use
the joinResult function.

There are several parameters in this function:

$pager->joinResult(source_column, join_table, join_column,
                   content_column, new_name);

source_column
This column matches the id from the joined table. In the previous
example, category_id would be the source_column.

join_table
The table we want to join to. Again, using the above, category_table
would be the join_table.

join_column
The column to join the source_column to (e.g. "id").

content_column
The result we want returned. In category_table it could be the "title"
column.

new_name
If you don't want result under the join_column name, give it a
substitute.

Example:

$pager->joinResult('category_id', 'category_table', 'id', 'title',
                   'category_title');

DBPager will also create a SORT tag for the new column.

One last thing, if you are using objects with you DB_Pager
implementation, you MUST create a variable for your object. In this
case I would need $object->category_title to exist.

Footnotes
--------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) Here is where it is important that your object variables match the
    table column names:

Table column    : title    > All is well, the title will be put into 
Object variable : title    > the object's 'title' variable.

Table column    : name     > Unless there is an object variable entitled
Object variable : title    > 'name', this information will get lost.


(2) Make sure you have the {TOGGLE} tag in your list.

Example <tr {TOGGLE}><td>{TITLE}</td></tr>


(3) Look in docs/template.txt.
