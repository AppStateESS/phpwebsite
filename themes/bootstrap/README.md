phpWebSite Default Bootstrap Theme
==================================

As of phpWebSite 1.8.1, all internally generated templates and CSS
were rewritten to be compatible with the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

This Bootstrap basic theme is provided for your reference; to get
started quickly on your own theme, copy it to a different directory
under `themes`.

If you have already made a theme that respects Bootstrap convention,
you may only need to remove your template overrides in the
`templates` directory.

Please DO use Bootstrap Scaffolding to design the basic structure of
your pages.  We are simply using the CSS Components in some of our
modules.  A future version may provide a web-based mechanism for
managing your basic page Bootstrap scaffolding.
