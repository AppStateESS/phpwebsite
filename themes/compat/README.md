phpWebSite Compatibility Theme
==============================

As of phpWebSite 1.8.1, all internally generated templates and CSS
were rewritten to be compatible with the Bootstrap CSS Framework.

This compatibility theme is provided for your reference.  Copy the
`templates` directory from this theme into your theme, making sure
NOT to overwrite any replacements you already made in the `templates`
directory, and your old theme will work for a little while longer.

**NOTE: We are moving forward at an accelerated rate, and there may be
further changes to how templates are handled in the 1.8.x series of
phpWebSite.  The safest thing to do is to make your theme work with
the Twitter-Bootstrap framework.** However, we realize that this takes
time, so we are providing this crutch temporarily.
